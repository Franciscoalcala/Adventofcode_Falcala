Files for the adventofcode

The file is for the first challenge of the adventofcode, I used Native PHP for the solution so you just need to install the latest estable version of PHP 8 (For reference to install PHP on Linux, Windows or Mac please click on the link https://www.php.net/manual/es/install.php)

On Windows Open the Command prompt and locate on the folder where the file is saved, run the comand php **NAME OF THE FILE**.php to let the file give you the answer.
